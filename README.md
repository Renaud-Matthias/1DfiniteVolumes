# 1D finite volume with python

This repository provides tools to perform one dimensional simulations using the finite volume method.


It is organized as follows:
- finVols1D: source files, mesh, fields, numerical schemes
- tutorials: examples of package applications to various differential equations
- tests: scripts catching code errors
